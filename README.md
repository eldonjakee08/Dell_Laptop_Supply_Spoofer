# Dell Laptop Supply Spoofer
So I have this old Dell Inspiron 3593 (2020 model) laptop and it kind of showing its age, with the battery being slightly bloated and relatively high wear level of 40%. ðŸ˜…

I know! I know! I should replace the battery ðŸ˜…, but I kind of thought "hey why not power the laptop with an external powerbank?" in that way I'm not limited to the laptop's internal battery and I could use my laptop anywhere for many hours without having to worry about a power source. 

I'm an outdoor person and sometimes I get claustrophobic inside coding all day, I would like to sometimes code outdoors, like by the beach, by the park or even in cafes. But with the current state of my laptops battery, I am not able to do those things and that's the main motivation behind this little project. 


# Defining the problem (define the challenges for this project to work)
So due to my laptops relatively old age (5 years is considered old in tech years ðŸ˜‚), it comes installed with a 4.5mm DC power jack. So challenge #1 is, how do I convert the Type-C port that comes with modern power banks into a 4.5mm DC power jack? My answer to that is with these little guys, USB PD trigger boards.

These boards are designed to trigger a USB Power Delivery (USB PD) capable power bank to output a specific voltage level (i.e 5V, 9V, 12V, 15V & 20V). In our case, we need a power source capable of delivering 20V at 3.25A (65W) which is well within the limits of a USB PD capable 65W Type-C power bank. 

So by using a 65W USB PD capable power bank + USB PD Trigger module + 4.5mm DC Power jack cable and plugging it into the laptop would make this work right???

Well, not quite, because Dell laptop power supplies implement an ID chip on its output stage for authenticity checking, output voltage check & output power check. If you just plug in a random 20V supply into the laptop it would know that it's not an authentic dell laptop supply and it would severely limit the amount of current that it would draw from it (800mA in my experience) which results in an underpowered & underclocked laptop leading to poor performance. This is our challenge #2, how to bypass the dell proprietary handshake between supply and laptop.

Notice from the schematic, Dell uses a DS2501 EEPROM IC for its ID chip, which is a 512bit 1-Wire prtocol EEPROM chip. This is where the serial number and power supply details are stored which is then read by the laptop when the power supply is first plugged. So in theory, if we read the data inside the DS2501 EEPROM, program it into our own ID chip and wire its output into the ID pin of our 4.5mm DC power jack, we should be able to bypass the authenticity check. 

So I probed the ID pin of the supply during handshake to see the data being exchanged. Heres what I got.

I wont go into details regarding the 1-Wire communication protocol, but what the logic analyzer data basically says is that.
